## Features

**Check and Uncheck Tasks:**
  Users can easily mark tasks as complete or incomplete by checking or unchecking them, providing a straightforward way to manage task statuses.

- **Column Placement for Tasks:**
  Tasks are intelligently placed under the correct column based on their status, ensuring a clear separation between "To Do" and "Done" tasks.

- **Alphabetical Sorting:**
  Both the "To Do" and "Done" lists are automatically sorted alphabetically, providing an organized view of tasks for better user experience.

- **Unlimited Entries in "To Do" List:**
  The "To Do" list supports an unlimited number of entries, allowing users to add and manage an extensive list of tasks.

- **Limited Entries in "Done" List:**
  The "Done" list displays a maximum of ten most recent entries, offering a concise and easily digestible view of completed tasks.

- **Real-time Search Functionality:**
  The application features a real-time search functionality. As users enter text into the search box, both columns are dynamically filtered to display only items matching the entered text.

- **Backend Storage:**
  All tasks are stored in the backend, providing a secure and persistent storage solution. This ensures that task data is maintained even if the user closes or refreshes the application.
